IT IS TIME to graduate from a spreadsheet bro who wears loafers and chews nicotine gum to a pythonista who wears sandals with
no socks and chugs energy drinks! Your python research will make your co-workers quiver in their untailored businesswear.

As an independent, uneducated futures trader, I've found myself doing the same research over and over again. 
Rather than writing a bunch of redundant code
and copying/pasting from other projects, I have begun to automate some of my research needs. The code in this
repository will encapsulate generic data analysis into several intuitive and reusable functions. This is a work in progress, but it will
eventually cover all basic needs like "what's the 2nd standard deviation of daily price movement up and down", and
"what are the returns in x compared to y". Once I get the basics out of the way, I will move on to the more advanced mathematical 
tools. And for you degenerates out there, I may choose to add support for intra-day data with special functions that 
are focused on day trading.

INSTRUCTIONS: Grab a .CSV file from TradingView. It is very easy to do. Pull up a daily chart of whatever you want,
then navigate to the top right. There's a dropdown menu next to your workspace name that has an option to "Export
chart data." Choose to export with ISO time, then rename the file to something easy with no whitespace. Then, you
just drop it in the 'data' subdirectory of this project. Now, you're ready to party. Feel free to commit the CSV you 
added to the repo with the comment "add csv" so other users can have access to the data without manually adding it themselves.

I encourage other finance enthusiasts (degenerate gamblers) to contribute to this project. If you've just been fired from
Best Buy, this is the perfect opportunity for you to start beefing up your resume. This is not a complicated project at all,
but it is technically considered data science. Should I make it an actual library? IDK.

Derivitaves trading involves substaintial risk of loss. The data extrapolated from this research is in no way an endorsement of any investment or trade. I am not licensed in anything.
