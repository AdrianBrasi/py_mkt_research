Why the VIX? 
Volatility is everything. It is a proxy for market sentiment, a good trading signal for SPX, and the only reliably mean-reverting instrument in the market (in my opinion). Even as a long-term investor, understanding the VIX will help you make decisions about what to do. Think for yourself, but don't think too hard.

This is just simple math, but it will eventually grow into something bigger. I am thinking about implementing other options statistics, as well as the VIX futures term structure, inspired by vixcentral.com with some other bells and whistles. I could do a standalone platform, or put it on a webpage. It will have a GUI and possibly support for one or several API's. IDK man, I'm just doing this for fun. I don't want it to be too expensive.
